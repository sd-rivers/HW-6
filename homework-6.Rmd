## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

```{r}

library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
library(ISLR2)
library(tidyverse)
library(glmnet)
tidymodels_prefer()
library(janitor)
library(corrr)
library(corrplot)
library(rpart.plot)
library(parsnip)
library(tune)
library(modeldata)
library(workflows)
library(ranger)
library(vip)

data <- read.csv("data/Pokemon.csv")
data <- data %>% 
  clean_names()

data <- data %>% 
  filter(type_1 == c("Bug", "Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic"))

data$type_1 <- data$type_1 %>% as.factor()
data$legendary <- data$legendary %>% as.factor()

```

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}

set.seed(3435)

poke_split <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = type_1)
poke_train <- training(poke_split)
poke_test <- testing(poke_split)

```

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}

poke_folds <- vfold_cv(poke_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)

```

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}

poke_rec <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, dat = poke_train) %>%
  step_dummy(c(legendary, generation)) %>% 
  step_center(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_scale(all_predictors())

```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

```{r}
cor_poke_train <- poke_train %>%
  select(is.numeric) %>%
  correlate(use="complete.obs")

cor_poke_train %>%
  stretch() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, fill = r)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = as.character(fashion(r))))

```

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

I notice that ID # is has almost 100% correlation with generation which makes total sense. Total stats is positively correlated with all of the constituent stats which makes logical sense. Defense and attack are highly correlated and may be because of the prevalence of normal types. 

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}

tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(poke_rec)

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res1 <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = poke_folds, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

autoplot(tune_res1)

```

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}

arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res1), desc(mean))[[1,4]]

```

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}

best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res1)

class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = poke_train)

class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()

```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

```{r}

class_rf_spec <- rand_forest() %>%
  set_engine(engine = "ranger", importance = "impurity") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_rf_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_rf_spec %>% set_args(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(), min_n = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(poke_rec)

```

mtry is the number of predictors that will be sampled for each tree.
trees is the number of trees.
min_n is the minimum number of data points in a branch for it to be split again.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}

param_grid <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(2, 7)), trees(range = c(1000,9000)), min_n(range = c(5,48)), levels = 8)

```

mtry = 8 represents sampling choosing all 8 predictors.

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}
 
# tune_res <- tune_grid(
#    class_rf_wf,
#    resamples = poke_folds,
#    grid = param_grid,
#    metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
# )
# 
# save(tune_res, file = "data/tune_res2.rda")
load(file = "data/tune_res2.rda")
tune_res2 <- tune_res
autoplot(tune_res2)

```

Increasing mtry increases roc_auc the most. Around 23 or 29 minimal node seems to correlate to the highest roc_auc. Finally the number of trees seems to yield the highest auc_roc around 2500. Additional trees are incrementally helpful at best.

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}

arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res2), desc(mean))[[1,6]]

```

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

```{r}

best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res2)

class_rf_final <- finalize_workflow(class_rf_wf, best_complexity)

class_rf_final_fit <- fit(class_rf_final, data = poke_train)

class_rf_final_fit%>%
  pull_workflow_fit()%>%
  vip()

```

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

Special attack was the most useful in my model. Generation and legendary were the least useful. This is not what I expected.

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 
```{r}

class_rf_spec <- boost_tree() %>%
  set_engine(engine = "xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_rf_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_rf_spec %>% set_args(trees = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(poke_rec)

param_grid <- grid_regular(trees(range = c(10,2000)), levels = 10)

# tune_res <- tune_grid(
#    class_rf_wf,
#    resamples = poke_folds,
#    grid = param_grid,
#    metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
# )
# 
# save(tune_res, file = "data/tune_res3.rda")
load(file = "data/tune_res3.rda")
tune_res3 <- tune_res
autoplot(tune_res3)

```

What do you observe?

There is a peak roc_auc at around 200 and 800.

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}

arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res3), desc(mean))[[1,4]]

```

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

```{r}

df <- data.frame(model = c('Pruned Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Boosted Tree'),
                 roc_auc = c(
                   arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res1), desc(mean))[[1,4]],
                   arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res2), desc(mean))[[1,6]],
                   arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res3), desc(mean))[[1,4]])) 

df
#points=round(runif(16, 4, 20),0))

best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res2)

class_rf_final <- finalize_workflow(class_rf_wf, best_complexity)

class_rf_final_fit <- fit(class_rf_final, data = poke_test)

```

The Random Forest was the best performing model.

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

```{r}
augment(class_rf_final_fit, new_data = poke_test) %>% 
  roc_auc(type_1, c(.pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water))

augment(class_rf_final_fit, new_data = poke_test) %>% 
  roc_curve(type_1, c(.pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water)) %>%
  autoplot()

word <- augment(class_rf_final_fit, new_data = poke_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)

word <- data.frame(word$table)

ggplot(word, mapping = aes(x = Prediction, y = Truth)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq), colour = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%1.0f",Freq)), vjust = 1) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue")

```

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

My model was 100% accurate on all categories.
